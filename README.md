📝 Overview
Project Hub Studio is a React-based frontend project designed around a structured project-management / project-hub style interface.

The application is organized into reusable React components, with dedicated sections for the main content area, project creation, project display, project summary, header, and footer.

The project uses Vite for fast development and optimized production builds.

Project Goals
Build a clean and maintainable React interface.
Keep UI sections separated into reusable components.
Organize project-related views into logical folders.
Maintain a responsive and user-friendly layout.
Keep the codebase easy to extend and maintain.

📦 Installation
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js
npm
Git
You can verify your installation with:

node -v
npm -v
